SIGIR 2024: Towards Ethical Item Ranking: A Paradigm Shift from User-Centric to Item-Centric Approaches

### Description:
Our GitHub code repository introduces a novel approach to item ranking systems that addresses ethical concerns associated with user-centric reputation scoring methodologies. By focusing exclusively on item ratings information, our approach strategically transitions its emphasis from scoring users to calculating item rankings. Through experiments conducted on three datasets, our method demonstrates superior effectiveness and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, the resulting rankings exhibit increased robustness against spam and resistance to bribery, paving the way for a novel and ethically sound direction in item ranking systems.
